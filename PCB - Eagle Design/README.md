# PCB        
A PCB has been designed on Eagle with the following components:           
[Reference Schematic]()          

* RF Transceiver:      
CC1121 - Texas Instruments

* RF Module with Type-C USB Connector: Designed using Eagle       
[RF Module 1]()        
This module can be independently powered via a type-C USB connector or it can also be interfaced with an MCU(includes VCC, GND, GPIOs and pins corresponding to SPI Interfacing of the module)     

* RF Module without Type-C connector: Designed using Eagle      
[RF Module 2]()       
Only for interfacing with MCUs
